The initial planning of the webpage:

What I want to create.
   I want to generate an informational website where people can learn about who and what CP Capital is (fictional Venture Capital firm).

To who?
   The website should not only be able to lure founders of fintech companies to contact the fund to explore options for funding, but also inform third parties about what the fund does and how it adds value to the founders.

Why create it?
   I wanted to create this website because starting a VC fund in Mexico to help entrepreneurs disrupt the financial services industry is my mid-term goal and I think picturing it this way will help me visualize what I'd want to convey.
