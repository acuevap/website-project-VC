Extra information about the webpage

About the website:
  - Almost all the information should be fouond on the main page (index.html) because I want the people that see the website to find every information even if they are not looking for it. 
  - I did add different pages for the team's individual profiles to avoid making the main page too text heavy. Users can access these pages by clicking on the team's pictures.
